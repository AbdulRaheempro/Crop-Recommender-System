# Crop-Recommender-System
Crop Recommendation System is a Machine Learning + Flask web app that predicts the best crop to cultivate based on soil nutrients (N, P, K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. Built with a Random Forest Classifier (~95% accuracy), data preprocessing, and a simple HTML/CSS front-end for easy user interaction.
